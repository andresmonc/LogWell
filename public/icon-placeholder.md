# PWA Icons

You need to create two icon files for the PWA:

1. `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

These icons should be:
- Square (same width and height)
- PNG format
- Transparent background (optional but recommended)
- High quality

You can create these using:
- Design tools (Figma, Sketch, Adobe Illustrator)
- Online icon generators
- Image editing software

Once created, place them in the `public/` directory and uncomment the icon copy lines in `webpack.config.js`.
