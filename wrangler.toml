# Cloudflare Pages configuration for LogWell
# This configures the deployment of the React Native Web app to Cloudflare Pages

name = "logwell"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

# Pages configuration
# Note: For Cloudflare Pages, most configuration is done in the dashboard
# This file helps with local development and wrangler CLI usage

# Build output directory (must match webpack output)
pages_build_output_dir = "web-build"

# Environment variables (uncomment and set as needed)
# [vars]
# NODE_ENV = "production"

# Build configuration for Cloudflare Pages dashboard:
# - Build command: npm run pages:build
# - Build output directory: web-build
# - Root directory: / (project root)
# - Environment variables: NODE_VERSION=22.16.0 (optional, .nvmrc handles this)
#
# Note: Ruby dependencies are not needed for web builds.
# If Cloudflare Pages tries to install Ruby, you can skip it by:
# 1. Setting RUBY_VERSION environment variable to empty or skip
# 2. Or updating Gemfile.lock to use Bundler 2.x (run: bundle update --bundler)

# SPA routing is handled by _redirects file in web-build directory
# The _redirects file is automatically copied during build
